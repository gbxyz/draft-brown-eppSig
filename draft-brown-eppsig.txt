Internet-Draft        Launch Phase Mapping for EPP        September 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This EPP mapping
   provides a mechanism by which digital signatures [RFC3275] may be
   incorporated into EPP frames.

   While EPP provides a number of security features, such as strong
   client-server authentication, it provides no mechanism for non-
   repudiation.  This extension provides a means by which the contents
   of an EPP frame may be digitally signed, preventing future
   repudiation by the client or server which produced them.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   "eppSig-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:centralnic:params:xml:ns:eppSig-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix
   "eppSig" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.


2.  Extension Elements

   This extension defines a single element, <eppSig:signature>, which
   may appear in the <extension> element of <command> and <result>
   frames.

   The <eppSig:signature> element may contain any element permitted in
   [RFC3275].


3.  Use of Signatures

   Servers which support this extension MUST include the extension
   namespace in the <svcExtension> element of the <greeting> frame.  If
   the extension appears in the <svcExtension> is present in the
   <greeting> frame, the server MUST include an <eppSig:signature>
   element, and a valid XML digital signature, in the <extension>
